## 🔧 Tools

- Native PHP
- *.tsv* table and *.txt* files for data
- Bootstrap & a bit of CSS

## 🪄 Features

- Dynamic contact page displaying current opening state of the shop (based on the current French timestamp)
- Form with *GET* method to calculate final price and create a custom pizza
- Views count of the whole website displayed in the footer (create and upload a new file each day there is a new visitor)

## ⚠️ For actual production mode

This project does not have any relational database, as it aims to display some plain native PHP skills. If you would like to check a full production-ready project with a SQL database, please check [that project](https://github.com/jiro-jasmin/Hot-Burgers/).  
Now, if you wish to use this project for production, please use a relational database to store the user email adresses. This way would be more secure and also easier to manage to actually send newsletter. To send newsletters, you can use a library such as *PHPMailer*.
